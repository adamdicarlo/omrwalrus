SpeedHack 2007 Entry

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

I built this on Ubuntu Feisty (x86_64), where I compiled Allegro, AllegroGL, and OpenLayer from source.

======================

LIBRARIES / OTHERS' CODE USED:

	* Allegro 4.2.2
	* OpenLayer 2.1, which itself uses:
		* Allegro GL (my installed version: 0.4.2)
		* FreeType
		* Png
		* Zlib
	* DUMB
	* counted_ptr class by Yonat Sharon [http://ootips.org/yonat/] (include/counted_ptr.hpp)
	* Makefile was snatched from Robert Ohannessian's SpeedHack 2006 entry and modified a bit

PREWRITTEN CODE OF MY OWN
