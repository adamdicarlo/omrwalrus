 Tools and Libraries Used
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Other libraries used:

   * OpenLayer
   * Box2D by Erin Catto (customized version; source included.)


 Notes on Compiling
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Change to Box2D directory and 'make' in there first.


 SpeedHack Rules
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

RADIUS: Circular pushers deflect objects from two corners of the
screen depending on proximity.

FRICTION: Sticky mats may be fired. They slow down walruses with
extra friction.

EVIL: You are depriving helpless walruses of their bukkits. They're
gonna starve, man.

REVERSAL: Normally in games you actively kill things. In this game,
you don't. (OK, the walruses are hungry, but nobody dies in the game.)

DIALOGUE: Nope. Act of Generosity.

RATIO, RESPECT: It runs in widescreen mode. Only, actually. Heh.


 About the Game
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Knock around walruses, and knock around bukkits. Get the bukkits
in the goal zone to score points. If walruses find the bukkits,
you can't score with them anymore.


 How to Play
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Shift to change items. Space to fire current item. Arrows to aim.
Instructions in title screen.
